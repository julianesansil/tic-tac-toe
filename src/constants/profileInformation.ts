  about: `I'm from Brazil, and I've been here in Porto since December last year.\n
  I've been working with software development since 2015. I've worked with AngularJS and React Native on the frontend and with Node.js and Java on the backend; and, I'm currently working on a React project.\n
  I already had a startup, with the objective of helping in the treatment of autistic children, but it closed down. ^^' But I still hope to help people through my work.`,
